# 📱 Mobile "Failed to Load Products" - Debug Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Code is fixed (all localhost URLs replaced)
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel to deploy
- ❓ Mobile still showing error

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Verify Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- [ ] Latest deployment shows "Ready" (not "Building")
- [ ] Deployment time is AFTER your latest push (check timestamp)

### ✅ Step 2: Check Environment Variable (MOST COMMON ISSUE!)
- [ ] Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
- [ ] Variable name is **EXACTLY**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (with BASE!)
- [ ] Variable value is **EXACTLY**: `https://veil-vogue.onrender.com` (no @ symbol, no trailing slash)
- [ ] Applied to: Production, Preview, Development (all checked)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ `VITE_API_URL` (missing BASE) - WRONG!
- ❌ `@https://veil-vogue.onrender.com` (@ symbol) - WRONG!
- ❌ `https://veil-vogue.onrender.com/` (trailing slash) - WRONG!

**If wrong:** Delete and recreate, then redeploy!

### ✅ Step 3: Verify Backend is Accessible
Open on your phone: https://veil-vogue.onrender.com

**Expected:** You should see text: "Veil & Vogue API is running..."

**If takes 30+ seconds:** Your backend was sleeping (free tier). Wait for it to wake up, then try again.

**If error:** Backend has issues. Check Render logs.

### ✅ Step 4: Clear Mobile Cache
Your phone might be using old cached code with localhost URLs.

**iPhone Safari:**
```
Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
```

**Android Chrome:**
```
Chrome Menu (⋮) → History → Clear browsing data
→ Check "Cached images and files"
→ Click "Clear data"
```

**Or faster:** Open site in **Private/Incognito** mode

### ✅ Step 5: Check What Error You're Actually Getting

**Method 1: Visual Check**
- Open https://veil-vogue-wi8x.vercel.app/ on your phone
- What exactly do you see?
  - Blank page?
  - "Failed to load products" message?
  - Loading spinner forever?
  - Other error?

**Method 2: Remote Debugging (Most accurate)**

**For iPhone + Mac:**
1. Connect iPhone to Mac with cable
2. iPhone: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Web Inspector (ON)
3. Mac Safari: Develop menu → [Your iPhone] → veil-vogue-wi8x
4. Check Console tab for red errors

**For Android + PC:**
1. Enable Developer Mode on Android
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect to PC
4. Open Chrome on PC
5. Go to: `chrome://inspect`
6. Find your device and click "inspect"
7. Check Console for errors

**Common Errors to Look For:**
- ❌ `Failed to fetch` or `Network Error` → Backend not reachable
- ❌ `localhost:5000` in error → Old cached code
- ❌ `CORS` error → Backend CORS issue
- ❌ `undefined/api/products` → Missing environment variable

## 🎯 Most Likely Causes (In Order)

### 1. **Environment Variable Wrong/Missing (80% of cases)**
**Symptom:** Error shows `undefined/api/products` or `localhost:5000`

**Fix:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Delete: `VITE_API_URL` (if it exists)
3. Add: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = `https://veil-vogue.onrender.com`
4. Go to Deployments → Latest → ⋯ → Redeploy
5. Wait 1-2 minutes
6. Clear mobile cache and try again

### 2. **Mobile Cache (15% of cases)**
**Symptom:** Works on desktop, fails on mobile

**Fix:**
- Clear mobile browser cache completely
- Or use Private/Incognito mode
- Or try different mobile browser

### 3. **Backend Sleeping (4% of cases)**
**Symptom:** Long loading, then timeout

**Fix:**
- Open https://veil-vogue.onrender.com in browser
- Wait 30 seconds for it to wake up
- Then refresh your main site

### 4. **Vercel Not Deployed (1% of cases)**
**Symptom:** Site looks old

**Fix:**
- Check deployment timestamp in Vercel
- Should be recent (within last 10 minutes)
- If old, manually trigger redeploy

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test 1: Backend Direct Access
Open on mobile: `https://veil-vogue.onrender.com/api/products`

**Expected:** JSON list of products (or empty array if no products)
**If error:** Backend problem

### Test 2: Environment Variable Check
Open on mobile: Press F12 (if possible) or use remote debugging

In console, type:
```javascript
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL)
```

**Expected:** `https://veil-vogue.onrender.com`
**If undefined:** Environment variable not set or Vercel not redeployed

### Test 3: Network Tab
Open remote debugging → Network tab → Reload page

Look for request to `/api/products`
- What's the full URL?
- Does it say `https://veil-vogue.onrender.com/api/products`?
- Or does it say `localhost:5000` or `undefined`?

## 💡 Emergency Quick Fix

If nothing works, try this nuclear option:

1. **Force Clear Everything:**
   - Delete Vercel deployment
   - Redeploy from scratch
   - Clear mobile cache
   - Restart phone

2. **Verify Environment Variable ONE MORE TIME:**
   ```
   Name: VITE_API_BASE_URL
   Value: https://veil-vogue.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Test in incognito mode FIRST** before regular browser

## 📋 Information to Provide for Further Help

If still not working, please provide:

1. **Exact error message** you see on mobile
2. **Screenshot** of the error
3. **Vercel environment variables** screenshot (hide sensitive values)
4. **What happens** when you open: https://veil-vogue.onrender.com
5. **Console errors** from remote debugging (if possible)
6. **Does it work on desktop?** (Same WiFi, different device)

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Home page shows product cards
- ✅ No "failed to load" error
- ✅ Can click on products
- ✅ Can login
- ✅ Works on both WiFi and mobile data

## 🔧 Double-Check Configuration

**In Vercel:**
```
Environment Variables:
├─ VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://veil-vogue.onrender.com
└─ (Applied to: Production, Preview, Development)
```

**In Render:**
```
Environment Variables:
├─ MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://...
├─ JWT_SECRET = your_secret
├─ NODE_ENV = production
├─ CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = ...
├─ CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = ...
└─ CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = ...
```
